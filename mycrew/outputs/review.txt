## Prime Number Checker Code Review

**Code:**
```python
def is_prime(n):
    \"\"\"Checks if a given integer is a prime number.

    Args:
        n: The integer to check.

    Returns:
        True if n is prime, False otherwise.
    \"\"\"\n
    if n <= 1:
      return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
      if n % i == 0:
        return False
    return True 
```

**Analysis:**

The provided code implements a function `is_prime(n)` to check if a given integer `n` is a prime number.

* **Correctness:** The algorithm implemented is correct. It iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds a divisor, it concludes that `n` is not prime. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that `n` is prime.

* **Readability:** The code is generally well-written and easy to read. The use of meaningful variable names (`n`) and comments explaining the logic enhances readability. However, adding a docstring to the `is_prime` function describing its purpose and parameters would improve clarity.

* **Optimization:** The algorithm's time complexity is O(sqrt(n)), which is generally efficient for checking primality. Further optimization might involve using pre-computed prime numbers or more specialized primality testing algorithms (like the Sieve of Eratosthenes) for larger ranges of numbers.

**Suggestions:**

1. Add a docstring to the `is_prime` function:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    \"\"\"Checks if a given integer is a prime number.

    Args:
        n: The integer to check.

    Returns:
        True if n is prime, False otherwise.
    \"\"\"\n
    if n <= 1:
      return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
      if n % i == 0:
        return False
    return True 
```
2. If dealing with a large range of numbers, consider using a more optimized primality testing algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
