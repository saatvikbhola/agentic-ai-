# Content Brief: LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection

## Concise Summary of the Text
The provided text details Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), which occur when user inputs unintentionally alter the model's behavior or output. These inputs don't need to be human-visible but can force the model to violate guidelines, generate harmful content, enable unauthorized access, or influence decisions. The text distinguishes between prompt injection and jailbreaking, noting that jailbreaking is a form of prompt injection specifically designed to bypass safety protocols. Two primary types of prompt injection are identified: Direct, where a user's prompt directly alters behavior, and Indirect, where the LLM processes malicious content from external sources. Both can be intentional or unintentional. The text outlines various severe potential impacts, including sensitive information disclosure, content manipulation, unauthorized access, and execution of arbitrary commands. It also highlights the heightened risks introduced by multimodal AI due to increased complexity and potential for cross-modal attacks. While fool-proof prevention is challenging, several mitigation strategies are presented, such as constraining model behavior, defining output formats, implementing input/output filtering, enforcing privilege control, requiring human approval for high-risk actions, segregating external content, and conducting adversarial testing. The document concludes with several example attack scenarios and references to related frameworks like MITRE ATLAS and other OWASP LLM vulnerabilities.

## Key Facts & Verifiable Data
*   A Prompt Injection Vulnerability occurs when user prompts alter the LLM’s behavior or output in unintended ways.
*   Prompt injection inputs do not need to be human-visible/readable to affect the model.
*   Prompt injection can cause LLMs to violate guidelines, generate harmful content, enable unauthorized access, or influence critical decisions.
*   Techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning do not fully mitigate prompt injection vulnerabilities.
*   Jailbreaking is a form of prompt injection.
*   Effective prevention of jailbreaking requires ongoing updates to the model’s training and safety mechanisms.
*   Direct prompt injections involve a user’s prompt input directly altering the model’s behavior.
*   Direct injections can be either intentional (malicious) or unintentional.
*   Indirect prompt injections occur when an LLM accepts input from external sources (e.g., websites, files) that alters its behavior.
*   Indirect injections can be either intentional or unintentional.
*   The severity and nature of a successful prompt injection attack depend on the business context and the model’s agency.
*   Prompt injection can lead to unintended outcomes including:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., AI system infrastructure, system prompts).
    *   Content manipulation leading to incorrect or biased outputs.
    *   Providing unauthorized access to functions available to the LLM.
    *   Executing arbitrary commands in connected systems.
    *   Manipulating critical decision-making processes.
*   Multimodal AI introduces unique prompt injection risks.
*   Malicious actors can exploit interactions between modalities (e.g., hiding instructions in images with benign text).
*   The complexity of multimodal systems expands the attack surface for prompt injection.
*   Multimodal models may be susceptible to novel cross-modal attacks that are difficult to detect and mitigate.
*   It is unclear if there are fool-proof methods of prevention for prompt injection due to the stochastic nature of generative AI.
*   Mitigation strategies for prompt injection include:
    1.  Constraining model behavior.
    2.  Defining and validating expected output formats.
    3.  Implementing input and output filtering.
    4.  Enforcing privilege control and least privilege access.
    5.  Requiring human approval for high-risk actions.
    6.  Segregating and identifying external content.
    7.  Conducting adversarial testing and attack simulations.
*   The RAG Triad is used to evaluate responses for input/output filtering, assessing context relevance, groundedness, and question/answer relevance.
*   MITRE ATLAS AML.T0051.000 refers to LLM Prompt Injection: Direct.
*   MITRE ATLAS AML.T0051.001 refers to LLM Prompt Injection: Indirect.
*   MITRE ATLAS AML.T0054 refers to LLM Jailbreak Injection: Direct.
*   Other LLM vulnerabilities listed are: LLM02:2025 Sensitive Information Disclosure, LLM03:2025 Supply Chain, LLM04:2025 Data and Model Poisoning, LLM05:2025 Improper Output Handling, LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency, LLM07:2025 System Prompt Leakage, LLM08:2025 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses, LLM09:2025 Misinformation, LLM10:2025 Unbounded Consumption.

## Key Concepts & Definitions
*   **Prompt Injection Vulnerability:** A security flaw occurring when user prompts alter an LLM’s behavior or output in unintended ways.
*   **Jailbreaking:** A specific form of prompt injection where an attacker's inputs cause the LLM to completely disregard its safety protocols.
*   **Direct Prompt Injections:** A type of prompt injection where the user's directly provided input prompt intentionally or unintentionally alters the LLM's behavior or output.
*   **Indirect Prompt Injections:** A type of prompt injection where an LLM processes external content (e.g., from a website or file) containing malicious instructions that alter the model's behavior or output.
*   **Multimodal AI:** Artificial intelligence systems capable of processing and interpreting multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text and images.
*   **RAG Triad:** A set of criteria used to evaluate LLM responses, focusing on context relevance, groundedness (accuracy relative to source material), and question/answer relevance.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM02:2025):** The vulnerability where an LLM or its application context reveals confidential data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or financial details.
*   **Supply Chain (LLM03:2025):** Refers to vulnerabilities that can compromise the integrity of training data, models, and deployment processes within the LLM development and operational ecosystem.
*   **Data and Model Poisoning (LLM04:2025):** The malicious manipulation of data used in pre-training, fine-tuning, or embeddings to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases into an LLM.
*   **Improper Output Handling (LLM05:2025):** A vulnerability characterized by insufficient validation, sanitization, or other forms of handling for outputs generated by large language models.
*   **Excessive Agency (LLM06:2025):** A state where an LLM-based system is granted a greater degree of autonomy or ability to call functions than is necessary or safe, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
*   **System Prompt Leakage (LLM07:2025):** The security risk where the underlying system prompts or instructions that configure an LLM are unintentionally revealed to users or attackers.
*   **Vector and Embedding Weaknesses (LLM08:2025):** Security vulnerabilities specific to the vector and embedding representations used in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems with LLMs, potentially impacting data retrieval and model interpretation.
*   **Misinformation (LLM09:2025):** A core vulnerability where LLMs produce false, inaccurate, or misleading information.
*   **Unbounded Consumption (LLM10:2025):** The process where an LLM generates outputs based on input queries or operations without adequate constraints, potentially leading to excessive resource usage, costs, or undesired content generation.
